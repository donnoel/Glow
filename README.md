## 🌟 What is Glow?

Glow is a mindful habit-tracking experience designed for people who want growth without pressure.  
It helps you track your daily practices, build meaningful streaks, and celebrate progress — all wrapped in a smooth, glassy, Apple-native interface.

Glow isn’t about chasing numbers.  
It’s about reflection, momentum, and feeling good about the small wins that add up over time.
